        PSP Bot : Pick Sort and Place Bot is customly designed, 3 Axis XYZ
        Gantry based Pick and Place Robotic Solution for Industry Packaging
        lines housing variable sized input items or boxes. It uses and efficient
        item sorting and packaging algorithm to pick and place input items from
        an incoming conveyor into an output container ensuring minimum space
        wastage. Its primary use is in the Multinational Packaging supply chain
        industry for variable sized item packaging and location based packaging.

        Smart Multi-Object Realtime Tracking (SMORT) aims to study major types
        of object tracking algorithms and finally build a robust object tracker
        which can overcome some critical problems like occlusion, light
        Intensity difference, re-identification etc.
        <br />
        This is a research oriented project in which a pre-existing algorithm is
        studied in great detail from its official research record and a custom
        implementation is created from it. This helps us understand some
        intrinsic details of the algorithm which prove useful while creating our
        original custom tracker. Implementation of object tracking research
        papers.
